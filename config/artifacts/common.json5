	/* Affects how common artifacts are in chests.
	   Values above 1 will make artifacts rarer, values between 0 and 1 will make artifacts more common.
	   Doubling this value will make artifacts approximately twice as hard to find, and vice versa.
	   To prevent artifacts from appearing as chest loot, set this to 10000.
