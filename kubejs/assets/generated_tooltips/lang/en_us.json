As long as the flower receives a redstone signal, it'll step the automaton twice a second. Each location within the flower's 25x25 area of effect counts as a _Cell_.

	"item.botania.terra_sword.tooltip.summary": "\"_A sword that fires a beam that damages mobs_\"  The _Terra Blade_, crafted from _Terrasteel Ingots_, is a sword infused with the strength of nature. It's on par with a _Netherite Sword_ in terms of raw power, and when swung, can sometimes fire a beam that will deal as much as a melee hit would. Additionally, it can use _Mana_ for durability, much like _Manasteel Tools_ can. No Broken Hero Sword",
	"item.botania.terraform_rod.tooltip.summary": "\"_A rod for terraforming_\"  While digging away at dirt with a shovel is definitely a functional means of landscaping, flattening huge tracts of land can get somewhat arduous. The _Rod of the Terra Firma_, by contrast, terraforms in a quicker and environmentally-friendlier manner. This rod, will, at a nontrivial cost of _Mana_ from the user's inventory, flatten surrounding land to your own altitude. For this to happen, charge it by _holding right-click_, and slowly but surely, the nearby terrain will be flattened to your level, either by placing _Dirt_ or by removing blocks. _Blocks removed by the rod are non-recoverable._The terrain will adapt to the changes as best as it can (up to a distance limit) to avoid weirdly-shaped hills and so on. The flattening, thus, will follow the terrain's natural shape. Note that the rod will completely cease to function below sea level....",

	"item.botania.thorn_chakram.tooltip.summary": "\"_Throwable vine weapon that bounces and poisons_\"  The _Thorn Chakram_ is a thrown weapon crafted from _Terrasteel_ and plant matter. When thrown, a chakram pierces through enemies, dealing damage with a chance to leave behind poison. It bounces off blocks, and returns to its thrower after about three seconds like a boomerang. Up to 6 _Thorn Chakrams_ can be stacked together, making them deadly in closed spaces. Spores and stingers",
	"item.botania.thunder_sword.tooltip.summary": "\"_Sword that calls upon thunder_\"  The _Thundercaller_ is a dual-pronged sword with the ability to conjure lightning. Crafted from materials like a _Terra Blade_ and _Ender Air_, it sacrifices the power of long-ranged attacks for the power to zap multiple targets in one stroke. An attack from the _Thundercaller_, in a crowd, will generate a chain of lightning that zaps nearby hostile mobs. Blessed Blade of the Trade Chat",

To use it, simply right-click with it and watch yourself soar. The rod, after usage, will briefly enter a mode where it negates fall-damage, keeping its user safe. A treasure from Lorule This rod can be given to a _Livingwood Avatar_. When so given, an avatar will use its _Mana_ to launch any players that jump near the avatar as if they'd used the rod themselves.

	"item.botania.travel_belt.tooltip.summary": "\"_Run faster, jump higher, and step more smoothly_\"  Traversing lots of terrain sometimes proves to be a hassle. The _Sojourner's Sash_ is a _Belt_ that, when worn, uses a trickle of _Mana_ to buff its wearer's movement speed, jump height, and fall-damage resistance. It also allows a non-sneaking wearer to step up one-block-high gaps as if they were stairs. ...everell",
	"item.botania.twig_wand.tooltip.summary": "\"_Your essential multi-tool_\"  A botanist's most important tool for manipulating flowers is the _Wand of the Forest_. This wand, crafted from a pair of _Mystical Petals_ strapped to a few _Livingwood Twigs_, is a must-have for a huge number of botanical tasks. The wand has two modes, _Bind Mode_ and _Function Mode_. In _Bind Mode_, sneak-right click it on a compatible block to select it, then sneak-right click elsewhere to bind the two blocks. In _Function Mode_ it simply doesn't perform this function, freeing the sneak-right click action up for other tasks. The two modes can be switched between by sneak-right clicking the wand in the air. Sneak-right clicking a block in _Function Mode_ rotates the block around the axis of the side it was clicked on-- for example, using the wand on the top of a _Chest_ will change the direction it faces. Most blocks with orientations can be reoriented this way. A _Dispenser_ holding a wand will use the wand on the block it currently faces, when triggered....",

On the other hand, when a bunch of _Vines_ are balled up, they yield a throwable item that creates a climbable string of strong _Vines_ on impact. Combining some _Livingwood Twigs_ with a _Rune of Air_ yields a slingshot that lets these _Vine Balls_ ignore gravity entirely. This would be in Vineacraft......",
